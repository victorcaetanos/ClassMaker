# Class Maker

Our professor assigned us the task of developing a comprehensive software application aimed at assisting a school director in managing various aspects of the educational institution. <br/>
The application will allow the director to efficiently handle the following entities:<br/><br/>

* **Students:** Register new students and maintain their past subjects. <br/>
* **Professors:** Add new professors and manage their profiles and subjects. <br/>
* **Disciplines:** Create and organize the different subjects offered by the school. <br/>
* **Classrooms:** Set up and manage classrooms available for instruction. <br/>
* **Classes:** Create class schedules and enroll students in them. <br/><br/>

The application was implemented using Java, MySQL for database management, and Java Swing for the graphical user interface. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and
also the use of interfaces for both the model and view, which allows for dependency injection, enhancing modularity and testability of the application. <br/>
